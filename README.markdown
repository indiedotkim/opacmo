[opacmo](http://www.opacmo.org) is the Open Access Mortar â€” a mash-up of biomedical objects linked to the open-access subset of PubMed Central.

Requires the lightweight server [Yoctogi](http://www.yoctogi.org/) for big data as backend.

Text-Mining and Web-Service Set-Up
==================================

opacmo requires [Yoctogi](http://www.yoctogi.org) as backend and uses [bioknack](https://github.com/joejimbo/bioknack) to create the text mining resources.

Text-Mining 
-----------

### Running on a Oracle Grid Engine Cluster

Prepare a 'bundle' on a cluster node with internet access or your desktop computer, which can later be extracted and executed on a [Oracle Grid Engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Grid_Engine) (former Sun Grid Engine) cluster.

    mkdir opacmo_release ; cd opacmo_release
    git clone git://github.com/joejimbo/opacmo.git
    git clone git://github.com/joejimbo/bioknack.git
    opacmo/make_opacmo.sh bundle 2>&1 | tee MAKE_OPACMO_BUNDLE_LOG

Bundling can take a very long time, because it involves downloading all open access publications of PubMed Central, downloading several biomedical databases/ontologies, and preprocessing the latter for the text-mining run. The bundle itself will be quite large too (&gt;25G).

Now transfer the bundle to the cluster, log-in to the cluster, extract the bundle and continue the processing on the cluster. It is important that the chosen path below is accessible (read/write) to all cluster nodes, which is usually the case with your home directory on the cluster or a designated shared mount point.

    scp bundle.tar username@nodeX.yourdomain:/path/opacmo_release
    ssh username@nodeX.yourdomain
    cd /path/opacmo_release
    tar xf bundle.tar
    screen -DR opacmo_release
    opacmo/make_opacmo.sh sge 2>&1 | tee MAKE_OPACMO_CLUSTER_LOG

Specific output of grid engine jobs is written into the respective `fork_*` directories as `opacmo.*.{e,o}*`.

Web-Service Database Set-Up
---------------------------

Install PostgreSQL 8.3 or newer, then -- on a Debian distro -- do

    sudo su - postgres
    createuser yoctogi
    Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) n
    Shall the new role be allowed to create databases? (y/n) n
    Shall the new role be allowed to create more new roles? (y/n) n
    createdb yoctogi
    load_opacmo.sh
    psql yoctogi
    ALTER USER yoctogi WITH PASSWORD 'yoctogi';
    GRANT SELECT ON yoctogi TO yoctogi;
    ^D


The `load_opacmo.sh` command expects the Yoctogi TSV files that have been generated in the directory `./opacmo_data`.

lighttpd
--------

Install and set up lighttpd. opacmo uses Yoctogi as backend, which requires FastCGI support.

    sudo apt-get install libfcgi-dev
    sudo gem install ruby-fcgi

Debian 5.0
----------

On Debian 5.0 you have to cheat a little bit to get the FastCGI going.

    cd /usr/include
    sudo ln -s ruby-1.9.0 ruby-1.9.1
