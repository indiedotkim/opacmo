opacmo is the Open Access Mortar â€” a mash-up of biomedical objects linked to the open-access subset of PubMed Central.

Requires Yoctogi backend.

Installation
============

opacmo requires Yoctogi as backend and uses bioknack's `bk_ner_gn.sh` to create the text mining resources.

PostgreSQL
----------

Install PostgreSQL 8.3 or newer, then -- on a Debian distro -- do

    sudo su - postgres
    createuser yoctogi
    Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) n
    Shall the new role be allowed to create databases? (y/n) n
    Shall the new role be allowed to create more new roles? (y/n) n
    createdb yoctogi
    load_opacmo.sh
    psql yoctogi
    ALTER USER yoctogi WITH PASSWORD 'yoctogi';
    GRANT SELECT ON yoctogi TO yoctogi;
    ^D


The `load_opacmo.sh` command expects the Yoctogi TSV files that have been generated in the directory `./opacmo_data`.


lighttpd
--------

Install and set up lighttpd. opacmo uses Yoctogi as backend, which requires FastCGI support.

    sudo apt-get install libfcgi-dev
    sudo gem install ruby-fcgi

Debian 5.0
----------

On Debian 5.0 you have to cheat a little bit to get the FastCGI going.

    cd /usr/include
    sudo ln -s ruby-1.9.0 ruby-1.9.1
